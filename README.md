# Basic Template

This is a template for a new react app with a few dependencies installed which I consider esential.

The src file comes with a few empty files to help organize your project:

- assets: for images and what-not...
- components: for components (duuh!).
- helpers: in case you like to store separetly multi-use constants, functions, etc...
- hooks: for storing your custom hooks.
- public: for files and/or directories that may be public.
- storage: for storing context states.

Also, a few prettier and eslint tweaks are added.

To start your project with this template run:

```zsh
npx create-react-app [your-project-name] --template @ptiry02/base-template

or

yarn create react-app [your-project-name] --template @ptiry02/base-template
```
