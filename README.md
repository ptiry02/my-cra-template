# Basic Template

This is a template for a new react app with styled components and react-hook-form dependencies installed.

The src file comes with a few empty files to help organize your project.

- assets: for images and what-not...
- components: for components (duuh!).
- helpers: in case you like to store separetly multi-use constants, functions, etc...
- hooks: for storing your custom hooks.
- storage: for storing context states.

Also, a few prettier and eslint tweaks are added.
